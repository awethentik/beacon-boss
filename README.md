# beacon-boss
An Ionic project that uses BLE beacon technology to help manage a mobile workforce. 

## Using this project

I recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli).

```bash
npm install -g cordova ionic
```

Then run to add Android & iOS platforms:

```bash
$ ionic platform ios android
```

Then run (builds and deploys the app on your device):
(device should be connected to computer)

```bash
$ ionic run android
$ ionic run ios
```


More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page and the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) repo.
